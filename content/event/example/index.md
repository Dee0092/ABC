summary: Interpersonal neural synchronization as a neural signature of outcome of mate choice.
abstract: "Although mate choice is crucial for adults, its neural basis remains elusive. In the current study, we combined fNIRS-based hyperscanning and speed-dating to investigate the inter-brain mechanism of mate choice. Each participant was paired with two opposite-sex partners (participants) in separate speed-dating sessions, and was asked to decide whether to engage in further relationship with the paired partner after each session. The physical attraction of the daters was rated by their partners at the beginning of the dating whereas the social attraction was rated after the dating. A significant interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex emerged between the pairs with mutual mate choice. Such INS could predict the outcome of mate choice. Moreover, social attraction rather than physical attraction affects INS during speed-dating. These findings demonstrate for the first time that INS predicts the outcome of mate choice of interacting daters in ecologically valid settings during their initial romantic encounter."
