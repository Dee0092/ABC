I am a research assistant in Shenzhen Institute of Neuroscience. I work with Prof. Li Hai Tan in the field of psycholinguistics. I study the human language process from both functional and structural perspectives. I am also interested in studying verbal communications under natural conditions. Taking the advantage of hyperscannig technique, which can record neural signals from two or more brains simultaneously, I conduct multi-person experiments and explore the inter-brain mechanism of online verbal communications.
